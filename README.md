# MySensors Controller
This project is a backend controller for the MySensors Ethernet gateway written in Java. It uses TCP Sockets to listen to data from the Ethernet Gateway.

Data is stored in a MySQL Database connected to a Laravel PHP frontend, providing a REST API for both the Java application and your own custom applications.
